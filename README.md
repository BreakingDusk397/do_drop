This python program uses the Alpaca API to stream stock data, create a Catboost classifier to predict future returns, and place limit orders on both sides of any given stock. To control inventory risk I use the reference price concept put forth by Avellaneda and Stoikov and the solutions from Gu√©ant, Lehalle, and Tapia. I am not an expert in this, so there are probably major mistakes in the code. Use and copy at your own risk.
